"Declaration" = "I would like to express my immense satisfaction in creating this game. Delivering it in such a short time and with so little experience required a lot of effort and dedication.\nWell, my name is Rinaldo Junior, I am neither a designer nor an experienced programmer, but like the character, I am on a journey of transformation. Throughout my life, I have faced many obstacles. Coming from a family without many privileges, I had a lot of difficulty accessing a good education. After much effort and determination, both from me and my family, I managed to get into university, which was a great achievement. But after a while, I realized that what I was doing was not what I wanted. I was no longer enjoying the course; it was nothing like I had imagined, and I seriously thought about giving up.\nHowever, last year when I entered the Apple Developer Academy, I discovered my passion for coding. It was difficult, but with each attempt, I realized that it was really for me; it was what I wanted to do. At the beginning of this year, after much thought, I finally gathered the courage to start over. After more than three years of studying Production Engineering, I talked to my family, dropped out of the course, and started my journey in Computer Science, my passion. It was a turning point, and now I feel like I am on the right path! I feel like I have found myself again.\nWhen I heard about the Student Challenge, I saw the opportunity to tell my story. I had the idea, but the problem was that I had never created a game on my own. I even dabbled in drawing pixel art characters, but I had never done anything on such a large scale and with so little time. But again, I gathered my strength and decided that I would not be satisfied until I delivered this game. It was really a huge mountain to climb, but it did not discourage me. After all, how many mountains have I already climbed?";
